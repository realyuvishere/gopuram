This is a fun project that I undertook while chatting with a friend. The program accepts an integer as an input which is **strictly greater than 4**. Based on the input, the program generates an ASCII based [Gopuram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopuram) in the console.

To contribute to the code, raise an issue.
